# Anomaly-Detection-Model
This project focuses on detecting anomalies in financial transactions using various machine learning and statistical techniques. The goal is to identify unusual patterns or transactions that deviate significantly from expected behavior, which could indicate fraudulent activity or other irregularities.

# Features

- Data Preparation: Tools for cleaning and preparing transaction data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summary statistics to understand transaction patterns.
- Machine Learning Models: Isolation Forest
- Performance Evaluation: Metrics and methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the anomaly detection models.

# About The Dataset:

The dataset contains information about various financial transactions, each represented by several features:
- Transaction_ID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- Transaction_Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
- Transaction_Volume: The quantity or number of items/actions involved in the transaction.
- Average_Transaction_Amount: The historical average transaction amount for the account.
- Frequency_of_Transactions: How often transactions are typically performed by the account.
- Time_Since_Last_Transaction: Time elapsed since the last transaction.
- Day_of_Week: The day of the week when the transaction occurred.
- Time_of_Day: The time of day when the transaction occurred.
- Age: Age of the account holder.
- Gender: Gender of the account holder.
- Income: Income of the account holder.
- Account_Type: Type of account (e.g., personal, business).
